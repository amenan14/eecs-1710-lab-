For this project 3,  I tried to create a decomposing effect with the images i drew. 
Through the pixels, i tried to make the outline of my drawings appear.
Through my project, the pixels are shrinking little by little in order to make a flower and a bird appear.
For the drawings used, i got inspired by images of flowers and birds, and tried to draw something new through what i saw.
